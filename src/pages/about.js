        <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Scott Fontenot, proud father of one amazing daughter,  
        Lindsey, human pack leader to our little cairn terrier, Mignon, 
        and husband to the one and only, Kate. 
        I call Washington DC home. 
        To pay the bills, I work on transparency 
        issues at US EPA, where I do some web development, 
        some data visualization, and a lot of program management.
        
        When I'm not breaking code, I'm enjoying DC with Kate, looking for the next book to read, taking Mignonne
        to the dog park,   </p>
      </div>
    )
