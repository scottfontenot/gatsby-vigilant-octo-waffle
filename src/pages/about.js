        <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Scott Fontenot. I live in Washington DC with my wife Kate and dog Mignonne.  
        I work at the US EPA, where I do some web development, some data visualization, and a 
        lot of program management. I created this blog as a personal project to learn about React
        and static site generators. I also intend to document what I'm learning and reading 
        in web development and data science, my struggles, and my wins. </p>
