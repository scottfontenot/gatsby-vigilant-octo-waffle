        <p>Iâ€™m Scott Fontenot, a late bloomer to web development living in Washington DC. Yep, I work in the Federal 
        Government, doing a little front-end development, a little back-end, and mixing in some data visualization. This blog is about JavaScript, 
        Python, Qliksense, but mostly about my journey, the struggles, the experiences, etc. </p>
