Welcome to my blog. And congratulations to myself for finally finishing this web site. If you can't tell by now, I'm new to this sort of thing. In 2017, I made a personal commitment to learn some web development skills. I wanted to do more at work, expand my career possibilities, and learn more about tech and programming. 

Fast forward to the present and I wanted to build a site as a personal project and to document my continuing journey into programming and data science... <!-- end -->
So, with a mixture of anxiety and excitement, I went live with this site. 
I'll likely be posting about what I'm learning or reading in any given month.  Otherwise all this stuff will just fall out of my frontal cortex, lost forever. 
First things first: 
* For the project, I wanted to get more exposure using React so I settled on using [GatsbyJS][0]. I also had some help from [Level Up Tutorials][1].
