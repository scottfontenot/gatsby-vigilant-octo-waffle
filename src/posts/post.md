Welcome to my blog. And congratulations to myself for finally finishing this web site. In 2017, I made a commitment to learn web development skill. I needed to expland my skill set and I was curious about programming. 

Fast forward to the present, I have some skills but I need to keep the tools sharp. I wanted to build a site as a personal project and to document my continuing journey into programming and data science.
So, with a mixture of anxiety and excitement, I went live with this site. 

First things first: 
* For the project, I wanted to get more exposure using React and SPAs (Single Page Applications) so I settled on using [GatsbyJS][0]. I also had some help from [Level Up Tutorials][1].
